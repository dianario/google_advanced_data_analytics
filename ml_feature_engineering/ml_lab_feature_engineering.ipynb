    "As you're learning, data professionals working on modeling projects use featuring engineering to help them determine which attributes in the data can best predict certain measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity, you are working for a firm that provides insights to the National Basketball Association (NBA), a professional North American basketball league. You will help NBA managers and coaches identify which players are most likely to thrive in the high-pressure environment of professional basketball and help the team be successful over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, you will analyze a subset of data that contains information about NBA players and their performance records. You will conduct feature engineering to determine which features will most effectively predict whether a player's NBA career will last at least five years. The insights gained then will be used in the next stage of the project: building the predictive model.\n"

    "- You should avoid selecting the `name` column as a feature. A player's name is not helpful in determining their career duration. Moreover, it may not be ethical or fair to predict a player's career duration based on a name.\n",
    "- The number of games a player has played in may not be as important in determining their career duration as the number of points they have earned. While you could say that someone who has played in more games may have more practice and experience, the points they earn during the games they played in would speak more to their performance as a player. This, in turn, would influence their career duration. So, the `gp` column on its own may not be a helpful feature. However, `gp` and `pts` could be combined to get the total number of points earned across the games played, and that result could be a helpful feature. That approach can be implemented later in the feature engineering process—in feature extraction. \n",
    "- If the number of points earned across games will be extracted as a feature, then that could be combined with the number of minutes played across games (`min * gp`) to extract another feature. This could be a measure of players' efficiency and could help in predicting players' career duration. `min` on its own may not be useful as a feature for the same reason as `gp`.\n",
    "- There are three different columns that give information about field goals. The percent of field goals a player makes (`fg`) says more about their performance than the number of field goals they make (`fgm`) or the number of field goals they attempt (`fga`). The percent gives more context, as it takes into account both how many field goals a player successfully made and how many field goals they attempted in total. This allows for a more meaningful comparison between players. The same logic applies to the percent of three-point field goals made, as well as the percent of free throws made. \n",
    "- There are columns for the number offensive rebounds (`oreb`), the number of defensive rebounds (`dreb`), and the number of rebounds overall (`reb`). Because the overall number of rebounds should already incorporate both offensive and defensive rebounds, it would make sense to use the overall as a feature. \n",
    "- The number of assists (`ast`), steals (`stl`), blocks (`blk`), and turnovers (`tov`) also provide information about how well players are performing in games, and thus, could be helpful in predicting how long players last in the league. \n",
